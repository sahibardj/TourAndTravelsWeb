    	<p class="py-3">
    		 Vasco da Gama Travels offers many private, customized day tours in many cities around Spain and Portugal – Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon, Seville, Granada, Malaga, Palma de Mallorca, Tenerife, Porto, La Coruna and others. By default, all our private tours include licensed, professional guides and a comfortable, air-conditioned bus (according to the size of your group) for the duration of the trip.</p>

			<p class="py-3"><b>Whom it’s the best for?</b></p>

			<p class="py-3"><b>Tourism groups.</b> All tourist groups heading to Spain, regardless of country of origin, age and group size, will enjoy our day tours.</p>

			<p class="py-3"><b>Business groups.</b> Groups that visit for business purposes, including trade shows, team building or business meetings, and have a day or two to spare exploring local highlights and surroundings can be accommodated - we’ll fit our tours to perfectly align with your business schedule.</p>

			<p class="py-3"><b>School groups.</b> We are firm believers in educational tourism and love entertaining school and university groups. Explore the history of the Spanish and Portuguese landscape and culture.</p>

			<p class="py-3"><b>Pilgrim groups (religious tourism).</b> Day trips to the main churches, cathedrals, and catholic places synonymous with the holy saints in Spain and Portugal.</p>

			<p class="py-3">We also encourage small groups (couples, families, groups of friends) to check with us about private tours. We try to adjust the pricing so it is economically convenient, even for a small group.</p>

			<p class="py-3">Special requests can be accommodated for all groups, regardless of the type and purpose of visit should you request it. We will include lunches and dinners, obtain audio phones for walking tours in the city centers, and organize tickets to any museum or tourist event.</p>

			<p class="py-3">We can organize guides to run the tour in dozens of languages: English, Spanish, Russian, German, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Mandarin, Japanese, Greek, Arabic and others.</p>

			<p class="py-3">Many other activities are available: culinary, language and flamenco courses, trips to theme parks, private boat parties, sunset cruises, tapas, winery and gastronomy experiences, events in special locations (castles, historical buildings or water park), and hot air balloon flights.</p>
